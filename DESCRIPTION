Description: Handling of behavioural data from the Ethoscope platform 
    (Geissmann, Garcia Rodriguez, Beckwith, French, Jamasb and Gilestro (2017) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003026>).
    Ethoscopes (<http://gilestrolab.github.io/ethoscope/>) are an open source/open hardware framework made of 
    interconnected raspberry pis (<https://www.raspberrypi.org>) designed to quantify the behaviour of multiple 
    small animals in a distributed and real-time fashion. The default tracking algorithm records primary variables
    such as xy coordinates, dimensions and speed.
    This package is part of the rethomics framework <http://rethomics.github.io/>.
